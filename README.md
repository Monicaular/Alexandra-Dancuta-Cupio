## Features

Every page has the same background image for the motto and a responsive navigation bar. Additionally, the social media icons are placed in the footer and mirror the header's colo scheme on each of the pages. 

+ ### [Navigation Bar](https://monicaular.github.io/Alexandra-Dancuta-Cupio/index.html)

  + The business's name, Neglelaboratoriet, can be found on the left side of the navigation, which is placed on the top of the page. When clicked, this would lead back to the top.
  + The additional navigation links are aligned to the right hand side and arranged in a row. These are called: Home, Gallery and Contact.
  + Because the screen is substantially smaller on a mobile device, the navigation links have a drop off toggle to allow for more room.
  + The navigation is capitalized to make it easier to see and is black in colour to contrast with the background colour.
  + All of the aforementioned information makes it easier for the user to find what they're looking for.
