            <p>

        </div>
        <h3>Gel Manicure</h3>
        <div>
            <p>A gel manicure involves the same process as a basic manicure, but with the application of a gel polish that is cured
            under a UV light. A topcoat is then applied for added protection and shine. This type of polish lasts longer than
            traditional polish and is a great option for nail art.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Polygel Manicure</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                Polygel nails are a type of manicure that combines the best qualities of gel and acrylic nails. They are durable, long-lasting and flexible, and are less damaging to the natural nail than other types of gel manicures. Polygel is cured under a UV light and is much lighter than traditional gel and acrylic nails.
