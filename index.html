          <h3>Basic/Standard Manicure</h3>
          <p>
            A basic or standard manicure includes trimming, shaping, and buffing
            nails, managing cuticles, applying cuticle oil, and a relaxing hand
            massage. The service ends with the application of standard nail
            polish.

          <h3>Semi-permanent Manicure</h3>
          <p>
            A semi-permanent manicure includes nail preparation, trimming,
            shaping, and painting with base and polish lasting two weeks. Ideal
            for healthy, hard, and short nails.

          />
          <h3>Gel Manicure</h3>
          <p>
            A gel manicure involves the same process as a basic manicure, but
            with the application of a gel polish that is cured under a UV light.
            A topcoat is then applied for added protection and shine. This type
            of polish lasts longer than traditional polish and is a great option
            for nail art.

          />
          <h3>Polygel Manicure</h3>
          <p>
            Polygel nails are a type of manicure that combines the best
            qualities of gel and acrylic nails. They are durable, long-lasting
            and flexible, and are less damaging to the natural nail than other
            types of gel manicures. Polygel is cured under a UV light and is
            much lighter than traditional gel and acrylic nails.
