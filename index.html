        <h3>Gel Manicure</h3>
        <img src="/assets/images/gel-manicure-compressed.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
          A gel manicure involves the same process as a basic manicure, but with
          the application of a gel polish that is cured under a UV light. A
          topcoat is then applied for added protection and shine. This type of
          polish lasts longer than traditional polish and is a great option for
          nail art.

        <h3>Polygel Manicure</h3>
        <img src="/assets/images/polygel-manicure-compressed.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
          Polygel nails are a type of manicure that combines the best qualities
          of gel and acrylic nails. They are durable, long-lasting and flexible,
          and are less damaging to the natural nail than other types of gel
          manicures. Polygel is cured under a UV light and is much lighter than
          traditional gel and acrylic nails.
